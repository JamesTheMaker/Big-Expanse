The mod is far from finished, but there is still plenty of content to enjoy anyways!\n\n[img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/zjizhpxh81824sd/descHeaderContents.png?dl=0[/img]\n - Removed Story!\n - Planet-specific dungeon generation!\n - Advanced planet generation!\n - Advanced BYOS system!\n - Craftable tools!\n - And much more!\n\n[img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/czgezg04bmxmn6l/descHeaderStart.png?dl=0[/img]\n[b]Big Expanse is not compatible with old characters and universes. If you want the full experience, you should back up your old characters and universe then wipe them.[/b]",
